=========
FM-index
=========

This repository contains educational implementations
of Burrows-Wheeler Tranformation and Ferragina-Manzini
index.

The implementations are fully commented and the main
goal is to provide clear implementations of BWT and FM-index.

Speed is considered secondary although there are
different implementations with different algorithmic
complexity.
